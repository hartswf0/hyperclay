        <h2>Beyond Words</h2>
        <p>Resonance requires engaging with both verbal and non-verbal communication to achieve deeper understanding. It involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attending to gestures, emotions, and silences</li>
            <li>Recognizing that 90% of communication is non-verbal</li>
            <li>Moving past surface-level narratives to grasp underlying meanings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Power of Resonance</h2>
        <h3>Shared Human Experience</h3>
        <p>Resonance evokes and builds upon shared human experiences, allowing people to connect across cultural differences. This approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deexoticizes people's compelling concerns</li>
            <li>Foregrounds immediate and mundane experiences rather than the spectacular</li>
            <li>Creates possibilities for enhanced human solidarity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodological Approach</h3>
        <p>Wikan advocates starting with people's compelling concerns as they emerge in everyday life. This requires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using one's own life experience to understand others</li>
            <li>Engaging with another's world through feeling-thought</li>
            <li>Maintaining a willingness to connect with different lives and ideas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Attending to Compelling Concerns</h2>
        <h3>Person-Centered Understanding</h3>
        <p>Wikan's approach emphasizes understanding people on their own terms by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focusing on immediate and practical concerns</li>
            <li>Recognizing shared human experiences across cultures</li>
            <li>Moving beyond cultural stereotypes and exoticization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practical Application</h3>
        <p>The concept has been applied across diverse settings, from studying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poverty in Cairo</li>
            <li>Childbirth in Bhutan</li>
            <li>Honor killings in Scandinavia</li>
            <li>Transvestites in Oman</li>
        </ul>
