Sharing a world with others means learning to attend to it in the same way. Such a practice dispels any mystique of \"resonance\" as field technique and epistemology. It is a down-to-earth concept, grounded in practical action. We need not have the \"same experience\" to be able to attend in the same way. But we must dip into the wellsprings of ourselves for something to use as a bridge to others. It does not come by an act of will, though will helps. Practical exposure to a world of \"urgency, necessity\" (Bourdieu 1990) is required. But for resonance to work, we need to shed the stifling preconception that can be a stumbling block along the way: that others are essentially different from us, to be understood only by means of their \"culture\"; and that their words bespeak different life worlds.",

I have argued for the need to cross thresholds along with people, and to bridge domains, if we are to grasp what concerns cannot be shed but impinge and require simultaneous attention. This methodological stance represents my own best effort to get a hold on those trials and tribulations by which people often feel 'trapped,' and to which Balinese bear testimony when they complain, as they often do, 'There's so much to care about!' It comes across as an oft-exasperated sigh about how to manage, to cope, in a life of multiple, simultaneous concerns. By perceiving people's struggle; by coming up against the enigma of clear bright smiles in the face of ordeals like bereavement and other crucial losses; by perceiving the quivers in a voice; by 'reading' somatic complaints about overwhelming pain and suffering, and.... What else was there? Too many things for me to remember now, for such clues do not stand out in the field notes I took, even when, after Oman, I had learnt to pay close attention to silent communication. Partly because when we work as anthropologists we are not truly implicated in the world other people. It does not matter that much if we understand them or not. Our misunderstanding are not likely to resonate with crucial effects. We are concerned to produce effects on the anthropological community, and only secondarily on the people whose language we are trying to grasp.",

We can do so in part because we do not experience the consequences of our own misinterpretations. We have this \"freedom from urgency, from necessity,\" because our anthropological observation point is \"founded upon the neutralization of practical interests and practical stakes\" (Bourdieu 1990:381, 383). Thus we are in a protected situation where we can build up our own little secret, carry it home, and busy ourselves \"with problems that serious people ignore\" (1990:381). Power and pragmatics enter, whether we like it or not. The interpretive quest in which many of us are entangled further works to segregate our lives from our works and to shield us from certain self-defeating aspects of our enterprise: it blinds us to the predicaments of people, and thereby also to our own.
