        <h1>Donald Schön's Reflective Model</h1>
        <p><a href="reflect-interactive.html" style="font-size: 2vh;">→ Experience Reflective Practice</a></p>
        
        <h2>Core Components</h2>
        <h3>Knowing in Action</h3>
        <p>This represents the tacit knowledge professionals use instinctively in their practice, operating below the surface of conscious thought. It's the expertise that allows experienced practitioners to navigate complex situations smoothly without explicitly thinking about theoretical foundations.</p>

        <h3>Reflection in Action</h3>
        <p>This involves thinking and adjusting while engaged in an activity - essentially "thinking on your feet." It occurs when practitioners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Evaluate and adapt decisions in real-time</li>
            <li>Respond to unexpected situations as they unfold</li>
            <li>Conduct immediate experiments to generate new understanding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection on Action</h3>
        <p>This takes place after an event or experience has occurred. It involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzing past actions and their outcomes</li>
            <li>Examining why certain decisions were made</li>
            <li>Considering alternative approaches for future situations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Principles</h2>
        <p>The model emphasizes learning through practice rather than just acquiring theoretical knowledge. Practitioners build a repertoire of experiences, images, and actions they can draw upon when facing new situations.</p>

        <h2>Practical Implementation</h2>
        <p>When implementing Schön's model, practitioners should recognize that reflection-in-action may sometimes interfere with the immediate action, as the stances required for reflection and action can be incompatible. The model is particularly valuable in professional settings where practitioners must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handle unique situations</li>
            <li>Deal with uncertainty</li>
            <li>Make quick decisions based on experience</li>
            <li>Learn continuously from practice</li>
        </ul>
